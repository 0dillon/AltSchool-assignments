        <section>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown the Meat:</strong> If using pancetta, add it to the pot and cook until crispy. Remove pancetta and set aside, leaving the rendered fat. Add the beef mince to the pot (or if not using pancetta, add directly to olive oil). Break up the meat with a spoon and cook until browned all over. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Deglaze and Add Tomatoes:</strong> Pour in the red wine (if using) and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cook until the wine has mostly evaporated. Stir in the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste.</li>
                <li><strong>Simmer the Sauce:</strong> Pour in the beef stock, add the bay leaf, and season with salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for at least 1 hour 30 minutes (preferably 2 hours or more), stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong> Remove the bay leaf before serving. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Cook spaghetti according to package directions. Serve the Bolognese sauce generously over hot spaghetti, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and the crispy pancetta (if used).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
            <p>
                For an even richer flavor, you can add a splash of milk or cream towards the end of cooking. <em>Don't rush the simmering process;</em> the slow cook allows the flavors to deepen beautifully. This sauce tastes even better the next day! You can also freeze portions for future quick meals.

            <p>
                <strong>Vegetarian Bolognese:</strong> Replace beef mince with lentils, mushrooms, or a meat substitute. Increase the quantity of vegetables for more body.

                <strong>Spice it up:</strong> Add a pinch of red pepper flakes with the garlic for a subtle kick.

            <p>
                <strong>Herbs:</strong> While classic Bolognese is simple, you can add a sprig of fresh rosemary or thyme during the simmering process for extra aroma.
